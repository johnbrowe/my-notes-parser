77. PHPStorm file encoding

For some reason PHPStorm keept encoding some windows encoding which was kind of annoying.

To get rid of this problem just go to settings -> Editor -> File Encodings Her you can change Ide Encodings, Project Encodings, Default encodings for properties files to UTF-8.

If you want this to be default on all projects do the same thing on "Default Settings".

73. Find object property in Array

Im falling in love with underscore.

I needed to get the index of a name in a object in an array.

And underscore a has many options. I used this:

var users = [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Bob', 'last': 'Brown'},
             {'id': 2, 'name': 'Ted', 'last': 'White'},
             {'id': 3, 'name': 'Frank', 'last': 'James'},
             {'id': 4, 'name': 'Ted', 'last': 'Jones'}];

_.findLastIndex(users, {
  name: 'Ted'
});

// 3

72. Vue.js passing args to the event function

HTML should look like this:
<ul id="demo">
  <li v-for="item in items" class="item-{{$index}}" v-on:click.stop.prevent="onClick(item)">
    {{ $index }} - {{ parentMsg }} {{ item.childMsg }}
  </li>
</ul>

Javascript should look like this: 
var demo = new Vue({
  el: '#demo',
  data: {
    parentMsg: 'Hello',
    items: [
      { childMsg: 'Foo' },
      { childMsg: 'Bar' },
      { childMsg: 'bla' },
      { childMsg: 'sma' }
    ]
  },
   methods: {
    onClick: function (obj) {
      console.log(obj.childMsg);
    }
  }
})


As you can see we pass the argument "onclick(item)" which is the same as the v-for item.

71. MySQL workbench alternative

I've been using MySQL workenbench on Windows for a couple of years and it has always suited my needs, 
but lately it has crashed more than my patience could handle. It mainly could not handle large tables.


So I tried out a couple of DB gui's for example Heidi SQL and Navicat.

I had problems with getting Heidi SQL to ssh in into Homestead (my Laravel envirment) so I could not use it.  

Navicat worked perfectly but it's very expensive.

Then I tried SQLWave and for my simple needs it works perfectly, there is nothing it can't handle in my enviroment and it's very easy to work with.

65. Reset SSD Ubuntu 15.04

cd /dev/
sudo hdparm -I sda

Then it will show some text, we are interested in this part, specically the part that says frozen:

"
Security: 
	Master password revision code = 65534
		supported
	not	enabled (this should be enabled)
	not	locked
		frozen  (this should be not frozen)
	not	expired: security count
		supported: enhanced erase
	4min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 
"

We want it to say not frozen and enabled

To do this write:
systemctl suspend

The system will suspend and then start up again, when it does write "sudo hdparm -I sda" again. 

Now it will say:
not	frozen

Now type to change enabled to not enabled:
sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass A-pass-word sda

Then the cli will display:
security_password="A-pass-word"

If you type sudo "hdparm -I sda" it should say: 

enabled (instead of not    enabled)


Final step, which will wipe the SSD which mean everything on the SSD will be lost, so backup if have something on that want.

Now type:
hdparm --user-master u --security-erase A-pass-word sda

63. Could not ssh into server

I had forgotten all my credentials to a remote server, which I really wanted to log in to. It was a digitalocean server so I could just login to my account and reset the password.

After this I tried to ssh in to the server in any possible way, but I just could not. 

When I wrote ssh root@ip_address

I got "permission denied".

So I figured out problem which was that I tried to ssh in with root and by default login in with root is not permitted. 

To test if this was the case I accessed to web console droplet and wrote:
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

So in this file I changed "PermitRootLogin no" to "PermitRootLogin yes" and then: 

sudo service ssh restart

After this I had not problem loggin in. 

My guess is that there is a reason why root is not permitted login by default, so I changed it back "PermitRootLogin no" and figured out how to create another user.

59. Kill Node process

Usually when you want to quit a node server you press CTRL + C or CTRL + Z.

But if you want to stop the Node server where you have killed of the terminal that you used to start Node.

You get this error if you try to start node again:

Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000
    at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:837:11)
    at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:860:20)
    at Server._listen2 (net.js:1231:14)

    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:452:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)

You can fix this with:

Write:
ps aux | grep node

Find the process ID, which second from the left (in my case 4 digits) it should look something like this:

root      xxxx  0.0  xx xxxxxx xxxxx pts/0    Sl+  09:18   0:00 node index.js
root      xxxx  0.0  xx  xxxxx   xxx pts/4    S+   09:41   0:00 grep --color=au

Then write:
kill -9 PROCESS_ID

For example:
kill -9 4485


and then you are good to go.

For example I set my path when installing nodejs like this.
If the path is: C:\Program Files\Nodejs do like this.

This string will be set the enviroment variable til you close prompt:
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\Nodejs;%PATH%

This will set the variable for good:
setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\Nodejs"

35. Vagrant Box stopped working

I got this error after updating homestead.

My solution was to delete current version, installing it again. 
In my case when updating there where 2 box versions, I think this could have been the problem though im not sure.

Open command line and write: 
vagrant box list

to see what boxes you have. In my case this was the result:
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.5)
laravel/homestead (virtualbox, 0.2.6)

To delete them you write:
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.5
vagrant box remove laravel/homestead --box-version 0.2.6

After that cd to the homestead folder and write:
vagrant add laravel/homestead

</div>

CSS:
.single-activity {
height: 45px;

It can be hard to style certain element because they disappear when you try to click on them.

$('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip('show');

OR

$('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover('show');

then through the developer tool navigate through the HTML to the popover element which in this case will not disappear.

I had problems starting PHPstorm as Ubuntu newbie, but figured it out by cd'ing to the bin directory in the PHP installation and starting the program by using ./ then a launch icon will be added to the desktop launch bar. Now you just right click the the PHPstorm icon a press "lock to launcher"

cd PhpStorm-133.982/bin

./phpstorm.sh 

if you want to start it from home, then:

As I am usually using blade and other framworks the vanilla PHP templating is not always so sharp.
Here are two functions to cut string.

echo mb_strimwidth("Hello World", 0, 10, "...");
or 
$string = substr($string,0,10).'...';

6. Accessing illegal name properties from PHP Objects

I quite a long time to figure this one out.

I had a json decoded object where the object keys had some illegal characters "this-is-the-illegal-string".

This mean that the usual way will not work.

$array = ['hello' => 'John', 'hello-world' => 'John'];
$objext = (object)$array;
echo $object->['hello-world']; // This does not work

The solution is to use curly braces
echo $object->{'hello-world'}; // This works

5. Express params

I just started using Express and had some problems on how to use params to display pages "blog" pages.

app.get('/notes/:note', function(req, res){

    var notes = require(__dirname + '/pages/content/notes.json');

    res.render(__dirname + '/pages/note', { note: note. [req.params.note]});	

});

You will notice that I use the :note after the path /notes/:note

This will catch the unknown params that are added to the path.

You can use this string/value with req.param.note

Note can ofcourse be what ever you want forexample :bla
then you would use req.param.bla to get the value.

4. Relative CSS link

I typical mistake is to make CSS links relative by not using / at the start of the link.

    <link href='css/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

it should instead be

    <link href='/css/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>


Write more about this..........

3. Wordpress WYSIWYG not showing

The WP WYSIWYG just disappeared out of no where for me.

My fix was to go to Users -> Profile (f.eks. Admin)

Check the Visual Editor checkbox

then save and 

then uncheck checkbox and save


This worked for me

2. Element disappeared on float

First problem was that i had set ul to float left, and when i figured out to set li to float it still disappeared.

The solution was found in Stackoverflow, which was to set ul to overflow: hidden;

1. WP child page menu

Here is a great video about how to create a child page menu.

I did not use the array_reverse function.
