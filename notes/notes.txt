4. Relative CSS link

I typical mistake is to make CSS links relative by not using / at the start of the link.

    <link href='css/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

it should instead be

    <link href='/css/main.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>


Write more about this..........

3. Wordpress WYSIWYG not showing

The WP WYSIWYG just disappeared out of no where for me.

My fix was to go to Users -> Profile (f.eks. Admin)

Check the Visual Editor checkbox

then save and 

then uncheck checkbox and save


This worked for me

2. Element disappeared on float

First problem was that i had set ul to float left, and when i figured out to set li to float it still disappeared.

The solution was found in Stackoverflow, which was to set ul to overflow: hidden;
